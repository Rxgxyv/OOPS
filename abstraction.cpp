/*Abstraction
Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system 
and exposing only the necessary features to the user.
In C++, abstraction can be achieved through Abstract classes, Interfaces (pure virtual functions)
    Sometimes implementation of all functions cannot be provided in a base class because we donâ€™t know the implementation. 
Such a class is called an abstract class.For example, let Shape be a base class. We cannot provide the implementation of 
function draw() in Shape, but we know every derived class must have an implementation of draw().
    A pure virtual function (or abstract function) in C++ is a virtual function for which we can have an implementation, 
But we must override that function in the derived class, otherwise, the derived class will also become an abstract class. 
A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in the declaration.*/
